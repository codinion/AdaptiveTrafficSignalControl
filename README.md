## Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using SUMO

### Comparative analysis of three models of Traffic Signal Control
- Static traffic signal control with set timeout
- Actuated traffic signal control with a traffic signal switch based on a timeout starting from the last arrival of vehicle at junction 
- A DQN model for learning and adapting to traffic patterns at the junction to enable adaptive traffic signal control.
