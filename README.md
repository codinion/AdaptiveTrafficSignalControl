# AdaptiveTrafficSignalControl
## Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using SUMO

### Done
- Preliminary versions are ready
- Static and actuated might not require much modification, only testing on different flow rates and generating relevant plots
- A basic DQN model with simple state variable has been implemented. Modification needed to make it accurate. 

###TODO
- Modify the model to generate proper results
- Generate required plots for the ppt/report
- Test on different flow rates
- PPT/report remains.
